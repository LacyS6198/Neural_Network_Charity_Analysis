# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis - Project Overview
The purpose of the project was to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be succcessful if funded by Alphabet Soup. A CSV containing more then 34,000 was used. The data included various columns that captured metadata about the organizations.

The data was reprocessed before having machine learning applied. After the data was transformed, it was fitted and scaled. It was then ran through a machine learning model. At first it was ran through ReLu and Sigmoid using two hidden layers. The model was then modified in an attempt to optimize it for 75% accuracy.

# Results

## Data Preprocessing
 - **Variable(s) considered to be targets of model:**  IS_SUCCESSFUL
 - **Variable(s) considered to be features of model:**  APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT 
 - **Variable(s) considered to be neither targets nor featuers of model:** EIN, NAME (these values were dropped from the dataframe)

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
